The R package **case-based-reasoning** provides an R interface case based reasoning on survival data.

This package can be installed from github by: 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sipemu/Similarity")
devtools::install_github("sipemu/case-based-reasoning")
```

The **Similarity**-package contains the C++-distance calculation functions for this package. The compilation should work on Ubuntu and Mac OS X out-of-the-box. On Windows you at least g++ verion 4.9.3.

Please use [Github issues](https://github.com/sipemu/case-based-reasoning/issues) if you want to file bug reports or feature requests.

# Features

This R package provides until now two methods case based reasoning for survival data:

- Cox-Regression

- Random Survival Forest (Proximity and Depth Measure)

Besides the functionality of searching similar cases, some additional features are included:

- automatic validation of the key variables between verum and similar cases data set

- checking proportional hazard assumption for the cox regression. This point needs ome further investigation, e.g. how the distance is biased when linearity and PH assumption do not hold. 

- C++-functions for distance calculation


# Near future implementations:

- analysis of missing values and imputation for the Cox model

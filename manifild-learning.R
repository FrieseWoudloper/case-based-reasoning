# Shiny App for manifold learning

You may now want to analyse your data with t-SNE:
  ```{r, eval=FALSE}
cbrDistViz(sc)
```

This opens a shiny app and you may then search for clusters in the by t-SNE reduced data set. 

**Note**: On big data sets, the t-SNE may need some time. Do not close the shiny window.
